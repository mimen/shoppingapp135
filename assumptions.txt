Assumptions

-When no user is logged in, and user tries to access any page other than "Signup" or "Login", the user is automatically redirected to the "Login" page.
-When a user is logged in, and the user tries to access the "Login" or "Signup" page, the user is automatically redirected to the "Home" page.\
-When a user enters the base URL, he/she will be redirected to either the "Home" or "Login" page depending on if he/she is logged in.
-The logout button that we added will enable one user to log out and another to sign in immediately from the same browser.
-There are no links on any pages to the "Product Order" page except for the "order this product" button on the "Products Browsing" page.
-An owner can delete/update only categories that he/she created.
-Our shopping cart is session-scoped, and it saves the order and all the line items on checkout
-The price is fixed at the point that the user added the product to the cart.
-We assume that the customer would want to go home at any point in time, so we included the link on each page.
-We included "Hello <username>" on every page, even the pages that customers can't access, for consistency.
-For owners, we included every link other than "Product Order" on almost every page for consistency.
-For customers, we included "Home," "Product Browsing," and "Buy Shopping Cart" on almost every page for consistency.
